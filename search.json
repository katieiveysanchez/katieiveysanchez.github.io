    "text": "Week 1\nThis week I watched the Quarto video from Professor Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, which I found very informative. I also created my own GitHub repository and several pages. I am finding Quarto in R Studio extremely easy to use; however, I am having some issues with hosting on GitHub. I am hoping to get these resolved this week.\nAdditionally, I have made progress on my research project for this course. I have selected a research question: What components explain the variability in New York Times op-ed coverage of the United States Supreme Court over the past year? To answer this question I want to conduct a principal component analysis of op-ed coverage of the Court. I have created a developer account with the NYT and generated an API key. I have also started experimenting with performing searches using this key in R.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
